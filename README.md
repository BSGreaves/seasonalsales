# Seasonal Sales Exercise

For this NSS assignment, we were given the task of parsing data from JSON format and printing it to the DOM using vanilla Javascript. We then had to add functionality so that when a "seasonal discount" was selected, the prices of all the goods would fall by the corresponding amount.

## Usage

Select a discount at the top and the prices in one category will drop accordingly.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/BSGreaves/seasonalsales.git
cd seasonalsales
npm install http-server -g
http-server -p 8080
```

This will show in your browser at:
`http://localhost:8080`
